Data Wrangling

Data wrangling is to take data in one format and turn it into a different format. Like | sign.

To wrangle data, we need two things: data to wrangle, and something to do with it. 

sed: a stream editor

  sed 's/.*Disconnected from //' replace any character (zero or more) started with "Disconnected from" with blank

  . means “any single character” except newline
  * zero or more of the preceding match
  + one or more of the preceding match
  [abc] any one character of a, b, and c
  (RX1|RX2) either something that matches RX1 or RX2
  ^ the start of the line
  $ the end of the line

  echo 'abcaba' | sed -E 's/(ab)*//g'
  ca
  echo 'abbc' | sed -E 's/(ab*)//g'
  c

awk: a programming language that just happens to be really good at processing text streams. 

You can do math directly in your shell using bc, a calculator that can read from STDIN! For example, add the numbers on each line together by concatenating them together, delimited by +:

 | paste -sd+ | bc -l

Or produce more elaborate expressions:

echo "2*($(data | paste -sd+))" | bc -l
